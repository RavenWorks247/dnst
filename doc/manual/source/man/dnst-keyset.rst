:program:`dnst keyset` ``-c <CONF>`` ``[OPTIONS]`` ``<COMMAND>`` ``[ARGS]``

Description
-----------

The **keyset** subcommand manages a set of DNSSEC (`RFC 9364`_) signing keys.
This subcommand is meant to be part of a DNSSEC signing solution.
The **keyset** subcommand manages signing keys and generates a signed DNSKEY RRset.
A separate zone signer (not part of dnst) is expected to use the zone
signing keys in the key set,
sign the zone and include the DNSKEY RRset (as well as the CDS and CDNSKEY
RRsets).
The keyset subcommand supports keys stored in files and, when the dnst
program is built with the kmip feature flag, keys stored in a
Hardware Security Module (HSM) that can be accessed using the
Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP).

.. _RFC 9364: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9364

The keyset subcommand operates on one zone at a time.
For each zone, keyset maintains a configuration file that stores configuration parameters for
key generation (which algorithm to use, whether to use a CSK or a
KSK and ZSK pair), parameters for key rolls (whether key rolls are automatic
or not), the lifetimes of keys and signatures, etc.
The keyset subcommand also maintains a state file for each zone.
The state file lists the keys in the key set, the current key roll state,
and has the DNSKEY, CDS, and CDNSKEY RRsets.
key generation (which algorithm to use, whether to use a CSK and a
KSK and a ZSK), parameters for key rolls (whether key rolls are automatic
or not), the lifetimes of keys and signatures, etc.
The keyset subcommand also maintains state file for each zone.
The state file lists the keys in the key set, the current key roll state,
and has the DNSKEY, CDS, and CDNSKEY RRsets.

In addition to the configuration and state files, keyset maintains files for
keys that are stored on in the filesystem.
Additionally, keyset can optionally maintain a credentials file that
contains user names and passwords for the KMIP connections.

The keyset subcommand uses the Keyset type from the Rust Domain crate to store
the set of keys together with their properties such as whether a key
should sign the zone, timestamps when keys are created or become stale.
The Keyset data type also implements the basic logic of key rolls.

The keyset subcommand supports importing existing keys, both standalone
public keys as well as public/private key pairs can be imported.
A standalone public key can only be imported from a file whereas public/private
key pairs can be either files or references to keys stored in an HSM.
Note that the public and private key either need to be both files or both
stored in an HSM.

Signer
^^^^^^

The zone signer is expected to read the state file that is maintained by
keyset to find the current zone signing keys, to find the signed
DNSKEY/CDS/CDNSKEY RRset and to find the KMIP configuration.

See <ref> for a description of the state file.

The signer needs to poll the state file for changes.
If the signer is in full control of running keyset, then the state file needs
to be checked for changes after running keyset with commands the can
potientially change the state file (status subcommands, etc. do not change
the state file).
If however keyset can be invoked independently of the signer then the signer needs
to periodically check for changes, for example, at least every hour.

Cron
~~~~

The signatures of the DNSKEY, CDS and CDNSKEY RRsets need to updated
periodically.
In addition, key roll automation requires periodic invocation of keyset
to start new key rolls and to make progress on ones that are currently
executing.

For this purpose, keyset has a cron subcommand.
This subcommand handles any house keeping work that needs to be done.
The cron subcommand can be executed at regular times, for example,
once an hour from the cron(1) utility.

However, keyset also maintains a field in the state file, called
``cron-next``, that specifies when the cron subcommand should be run next.
Running the cron subcommand early is fine, the current time is compared
again the ``cron-next`` field and the subcommand exits early if
``cron-next`` is in the future.
Running the cron subcommand late may cause signatures to expire.

Create / Init
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The initialisation of a key set for a zone consists of two steps.
First the create subcommand create a configuration file with mostly default
values and a state file without any keys.
The init subcommand finishes the initialisation.

This two step procedure allows configuration parameters to be set between
the create and the init subcommand, for example, the algorithm to use.
It also allows existing public/private key pairs to be imported.

The init subcommand checks if any public/private key pairs have been imported.
If so, init checks if both a both roles (KSK and ZSK) are present.
A single CSK combines both rolls.
Absent a CSK, both a KSK and a ZSK need to be present otherwise the init command
fails.
Any imported public keys are ignored by init.

If no public/private key pairs have been imported then the init subcommand
will start an algorithm roll.
The algorithm roll will create new keys based on the current configuration:
either as files or in an HSM and either a CSK or a pair of KSK and ZSK.

Key Rolls
~~~~~~~~~

The keyset subcommand can perform four different types of key rolls:
KSK rolls, ZSK rolls, CSK rolls and algorithm rolls.
A KSK roll replaces one KSK with a new KSK.
Similarly, a ZSK roll replaces one ZSK with a new ZSK.
A CSK roll also replaces a CSK with a new CSK but the roll also treats a
pair of KSK and ZSK keys as equivalent to a CSK.
So a CSK roll can also roll from KSK plus ZSK to a new CSK or from a CSK
to new a KSK and ZSK pair.
Note that a roll from KSK plus ZSK to a new KSK plus ZSK pair
is also supported.
Finally, an algorithm roll is similar to a CSK roll, but designed in
a specific way to handle the case where the new key or keys have an algorithm
that is different from one used by the current signing keys.

The KSK and ZSK rolls are completely independent and can run in parallel.
Consistency checks are performed at the start of a key roll.
For example, a KSK key roll cannot start when another KSK is in progress or
when a CSK or algorithm roll is in progress.
A KSK roll cannot start either when the current signing key is a CSK or
when the configuration specifies that the new signing key has to be a CSK.
Finally, KSK rolls are also prevented when the algorithm for new keys is
different from the one used by the current key.
Similar limitations apply to the other roll types. Note however that an
algorithm roll can be started even when it is not needed.

A key roll consists of six steps: ``start-roll``, ``propagation1-complete``,
``cache-expired1``, ``propagation2-complete``, ``cache-expired2``, and
``roll-done``.
For each key roll these six steps follow in the same order.
Associated which each step is a (possibly empty) list of actions.
Actions fall in three categories.
The first category consists of actions that require updating the zone or the
parent zone.
The second category consists of actions that require checking if changes
have propagated to all nameservers and require reporting of the
TTLs of the changed RRset as seen at the nameservers.
Finally, the last category requires waiting for changes to propagate to
all nameservers but there is no need to report the TTL.

Typically, in a list of actions, an action of the first category is paired
with one from the second of third category.
For example, ``UpdateDnskeyRrset`` is paired with either
``ReportDnskeyPropagated`` or ``WaitDnskeyPropagated``.

A key roll starts with the ``start-roll`` step, which creates new keys.
The next step, ``propagation1-complete`` has a TTL argument which is the
maximum of the TTLs of the Report actions.
The ``cache-expired1`` and ``cache-expired2`` have no associated actions.
They simply require waiting for the TTL (in seconds) reported by the
previous ``propagation1-complete`` or ``propagation2-complete``.
The ``propagation2-complete`` step is similar to the ``propagation1-complete`` step.
Finally, the ``roll-done`` step typically has associated Wait actions.
These actions are cleanup actions and are harmless but confusing if they
are skipped.

The keyset subcommand provides fine grained control over automation.
Automation is configured separately for each of the four roll types.
For each roll type, there are four booleans called ``start``, ``report``,
``expire`` and ``done``.

When set, the ``start`` boolean directs the cron subcommand to start a key roll
when a relevant key has expired.
A KSK or a ZSK key roll can start automatically if respectively a KSK or a ZSK
has expired.
A CSK roll can start automatically when a CSK has expired but also when a KSK or
ZSK has expired and the new key will be a CSK.
Finally, an algorithm roll can start automatically when the new algorithm is
different from the one used by the existing keys and any key has expired.

The ``report`` flags control the automation of the ``propagation1-complete``
and ``propagation2-complete`` steps.
When enabled, the cron subcommand contacts the nameservers of the zone or
(in the case of ``ReportDsPropagated``, the nameservers of the parent zone)
to check if changes have propagated to all nameservers.
The check obtains the list of nameservers from the apex of the (parent) zone
and collects all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
For the ``ReportDnskeyPropagated`` and ``ReportDsPropagated`` actions, each address is
the queried to see if the DNSKEY RRset or DS RRset match
the KSKs.
The ``ReportRrsigPropagated`` action is more complex.
First the entire zone is transferred from the primary nameserver listed in the
SOA record.
Then all relevant signatures are checked if they have the expected key tags.
The maximum TTL in the zone is recorded to be reported.
Finally, all addresses of listed nameservers are checked to see if they
have a SOA serial that is greater than or equal to the one that was checked.

Automation of ``cache-expired1`` and ``cache-expired2`` is enabled by the
``expire`` boolean.
When enabled, the cron subcommand simply checks if enough time has passed
to invoke ``cache-expired1`` or ``cache-expired2``.

Finally the ``done`` boolean enables automation of the ``roll-done`` step.
This automation is very similar to the ``report`` automation.
The only difference is that the Wait actions are automated so propagation
is tracked but no TTL is reported.

Fine grained control of over automation makes it possible to automate
KSK or algorithm without starting them automatically.
Or let a key roll progress automatically except that the ``cache-expired``
steps must be done manually in order to be able to insert extra manual steps.

The ``report`` and ``done`` automations require that keyset has network access
to all nameservers of the zone and all nameservers of the parent.

The configuration variables ``autoremove`` and ``autoremove-delay``
control the automatic removal of keys that are no longer needed.
The variable ``autoremove`` defaults to false.
In this case, stale keys have to be removed manually.
When ``autoremove`` is set to true, the ``cron`` subcommand checks if any
keys have been stale for at least ``autoremove-delay``, and if so, removes
those keys.
The ``autoremove-delay`` variable defaults to one week.

HSM Support (KMIP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The keyset subcommand supports keys in Hardware Security Modules (HSM) through
the KMIP protocol.
The most common way to access keys in HSMs is through the PKCS #11 interface.
The PKCS #11 interface involves loading a shared library into the process
that needs to access the HSM.
This is unattractive for two reasons:

1) Loading an arbitrary (binary) shared libary negates the memory security
   features of an application written in Rust. A mistake in the shared library
   could corrupt memory that is used by the application. For this reason it is
   attractive to load the shared library into a separate process.

2) Setting up the run-time environment of the shared library is often complex.
   The library may require specific environment variables or access to specific
   files or devices. This complexity impacts every application that wants
   to use the shared library.

For these reasons it was decided to write a separate program, called
kmip2kpcs11, that uses the PKCS #11 standard to have access to an HSM and
provides a KMIP server interface. This makes it possible to contain both
the configuration complexity and the possibility of memory corruption in
a single program.
Other programs, such as the keyset subcommand then use the KMIP protocol to
indirectly access the HSM via the kmip2kpcs11 program.
Support for the KMIP protocol also makes it possible to directly connect to
KMIP capable HSMs.

The keyset subcommand stores two pieces of KMIP configuration.
The first is a list of KMIP servers.
Each KMIP server has a ``server ID`` that is used in key references to specify
in which server the key is stored.
A server also has a DNS name or IP address and a port to connect to the server.
The second piece of configuration is the ID of the server to be used for
creating new keys.
It is possible to specify that no server is to be used for new keys, in that
case new keys will be created by keyset and stored as files.

Authentication can be done either with a user name and password or with
a client-side certificate.
The user name and password are KMIP concepts that are mapped by the
cascade-hsm-bridge server to a PKCS #11 slot or token name and the PIN.
With this approach the cascade-hsm-bridge server des not have to store secrets
that provide access to the HSM.
User names and passwords are stored in a separate file to avoid storing
secrets in the keyset configuration or state files.

Unlike other configuration, the list of KMIP servers is stored in the state
file.
The reason for doing that is that signers also need the same KMIP server list
to be able to sign a zone.
By storing the server list in the state file, a signer has to read only the
state file to be able to use KMIP keys.

Options that can be configured for a server include not checking the
server's certificate, specifying the server's certificate or certificate
authority, various connection parameters such as connect timeout, read
timeout, write timeout and maximum response size.

When generating new keys, the label of the key can have a user supplied prefix.
This can be used, for example, to show that a key is for
development or testing.
Finally, some HSMs allow longer labels than others.
On HSMs that allow longer labels than the 32 character default, raising the
maximum label length can avoid truncation for longer domain names.
On HSMs that have a limit that is lower than the default, setting the correct
length avoids errors when creating keys.

Importing Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three basic ways to import exiting keys: public-key,
a public/private key pair from files or a public/private key pair in an HSM.

A public key can only be imported from a file.
When the key is imported the name of the file is converted to a URL and stored in the key set and
the key will be included in the DNSKEY RRset.
This is useful for certain migrations and to manually implement a
multi-signer DNSSEC signing setup.
Note that automation does not work for this case.

A public/private key pair can be imported from files.
It is sufficient to give the name of the file that holds the public key if
the filename ends in ``.key`` and the filename of the private key is the
same except that it ends in ``.private``.
If this is not the case then the private key filename must be specified
separately.

In order to use keys stored in a HSM the ``dnst keyset kmip add-server``
subcommand must first be used to associate the KMIP server connection settings
with a user defined server ID.

The first server defined becomes the default. If a default KMIP server has
been defined it will be used to generate all future keys, unless the ``dnst
keyset kmip disable`` command is issued. If more than one KMIP server is
defined, only one can be the default server at any time. Use the ``dnst
keyset kmip set-default`` command to change which KMIP server will be used
to generate future keys. Note that like all ``dnst keyset`` subcommands, the
KMIP subcommands set behaviour for a single zone. Additionally there are
``list-servers``, ``get-server``, ``modify-server`` and ``remove-server``
subcommands for inspecting and altering the configured KMIP server settings.

Importing a public/private key stored in an HSM requires specifying the KMIP
server ID, the ID of the public key, the ID of the private key, the
DNSSEC algorithm of the key and the flags (typically 256 for a ZSK and
257 for a KSK).


Normally, keyset assumes ownership of any keys it holds.
This means that when a key is deleted from the key set, the keyset subcommand
will also delete the files that hold the public and private keys or delete the
keys from the HSM that was used to create them.

For an imported public/private key pair this is considered too dangerous
because another signer may need the keys.
For this reason keys are imported in so-called ``decoupled`` state.
When a decoupled key is deleted, only the reference to the key is deleted
from the key set, the underlying keys are left untouched.
There is a ``--coupled`` option to tell keyset to take ownership of the key.


Migration
~~~~~~~~~

The keyset subcommand has no direct support for migration.
Migration has to be done manually using the import commands.
The semantics of the import commands are described in the previous section.
This section focuses on how the import command can be used to perform a
migration.

There are three migration strategies: 1) importing the existing signer's
(private) signing keys, 2) a full multi-signer migration and 3)
a partial multi-signer migration.

Importing the existing signer's signing keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Importing the existing signer's public/private keys pairs is the easiest
migration mechanism.
The basic process is the following:

* Disable (automatic) key rolls on the existing signer.

* Disable automatic key rolls before executing the create command.
  For example by setting the KSK, ZSK, and CSK validities to ``off``.

* Import the KSK and ZSK (or CSK) as files or using KMIP between the
  create and init commands.

* Check with tools such as ldns-verify-zone that the new zone is secure with
  the existing DS record at the parent.

* Switch the downstream secondaries that serve the zone to receive the
  signed zone from the new signer.

* Perform key rolls for the KSK and ZSK (or the CSK).

* (If wanted) enable automatic key rolls.

* Remove the zone from the old signer.

Note that after the key roll, the signer has to make sure that it
keeps access to signing keys.
In case of KMIP keys, the old signer can also delete the keys from the HSM.
For this reason it is best to perform key rolls of all keys before removing
the zone from the old signer.

This document describes key management. Care should be taken that other
parameters, such as the use of NSEC or NSEC3, are
the same (to avoid confusion) and that the SOA serial policy is the same
(to avoid problems with zone transfers).

Full multi-signer migration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The basic idea is to execute the following steps:

* Disable (automatic) key rolls on the existing signer.

* If the parent supports automatic updating of the DS record using CDS/CDNSKEY
  (RFC 8078) then disable the generation of CDS/CDNSKEY records on the
  existing signer or disable CDS/CDNSKEY processing for this zone at the parent.

* Issue the create command.

* Disable automatic key rolls.

* (Disable CDS/CDNSKEY generation. Keyset cannot disable CDS/CDNSKEY generation at the moment)

* Import the public key of the existing signer's ZSK (or CSK) use the
  ``keyset import public-key`` subcommand.

* Issue the init command.

* Make sure in the next step to only add a DS record at the parent, not
  delete the existing one.

* Complete the initial algorithm roll.

* Verify using tools such as ldns-verify-zone that the zone is correctly
  signed.

* Import the public key of the new ZSK (or CSK) in the existing signer.

* Verify that all nameservers that serve the zone have the new ZSK in the
  DNSKEY RRset of the existing signer.

* Transition the nameservers from the existing signer to the new signer.

* Let caches expire for the DNSKEY RRset of the old signer and the
  zone RRSIGs of the old signer.

* Remove the DS record for the old signer from the parent.

* Remove the imported public key.

* (If wanted) enable automatic key rolls and generation of CDS/CDNSKEY
  records.

Partial multi-signer migration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A partial multi-signer migration is the right approach when the existing
signer cannot import the new signers ZSK.
A requirement is that the new signer can transfer the signed zone from the
existing signer and that the new signer supports so-called "pass-through"
mode.
In pass-through mode a signer leaves signatures for zone records unchanged
but does replace the DNSKEY, CDS and CDNSKEY RRset with the ones from
this subcommand.

The basic idea is to execute the following steps:

* Disable (automatic) key rolls on the existing signer.

* If the parent supports automatic updating of the DS record using CDS/CDNSKEY
  (RFC 8078) then disable the generation of CDS/CDNSKEY records in the
  existing signer or disable CDS/CDNSKEY processing for this zone at the parent.

* Issue the create command.

* Disable automatic key rolls.

* (Disable CDS/CDNSKEY generation. Keyset cannot disable CDS/CDNSKEY generation at the moment)

* Import the public key of the existing signer's ZSK (or CSK).

* Issue the init command.

* Switch the new signer to pass-through mode. The signer has to transfer the
  signed zone from the existing signer.

* Make sure in the next step to only add a DS record at the parent, not
  the delete the existing one.

* Complete the initial algorithm roll.

* Verify using tools such as ldns-verify-zone that the zone is correctly
  signed.

* Transition the nameservers from the existing signer to the new signer.

* Let caches expire for the DNSKEY RRset of the old signer.

* Remove the DS record for the old signer from the parent.

* Switch off pass-through mode.

* Let caches expire for the zone RRSIGs of the old signer.

* Remove the imported public key.

* (If wanted) enable automatic key rolls and generation of CDS/CDNSKEY
  records.

Options
-------

.. option:: -c

      Configuration file.

..
	.. option:: -v

	      Enable verbose output.

.. option:: -h, --help

      Print the help text (short summary with ``-h``, long help with
      ``--help``).

Commands
--------

The keyset subcommand provides the following commands:

* create

  Create empty configuration and state files for a domain.

  .. option:: -n

      The name of the domain for which signing keys will be managed.

  .. option:: -s

      The name of the state file.

* init

  Initialize the keyset.
  If a KSK and ZSK (or a CSK) have been imported then the DNSKEY RRset will
  be created and signed.
  If there are no keys, then a KSK and a ZSK will be created (unless the
  use-csk option is set to true) and an algorithm roll will be started.
  The init command will fail if the keyset has been initialized already.

* ksk, zsk, csk, and algorithm

  The ksk, zsk, csk, and algorithm commands perform manual key roll steps.
  These commands have the following subcommands:

  * start-roll

    Start a key roll of the type specified by the command.

  * propagation1-complete <TTL>

    Inform keyset that the changed RRsets and signatures have propagated.
    Report the maximum TTL of the report actions.

  * cache-expired1

    Inform keyset that enough time has passed that caches should have expired.
    Note that this command will fail if invoked too early.

  * propagation2-complete <TTL>

    This command is similar to propagation1-complete.

  * cache-expired2

    This command is similar to cache-expired1.

  * roll-done

    Inform keyset that the changed RRsets and signatures have propagated
    and that any wait actions have been executed successfully.

* import

  The import command can either import a public key in a file or a
  public/private key pair in either files or as KMIP references.

  * public-key <PATH>

    A reference to a public key in <PATH> is added to the keyset.
    Imported public keys are added to the DNSKEY RRset.

  * ksk, zsk, csk

    A key pair is imported as a KSK, ZSK, or CSK.
    When a key is imported, there is the question what to do when the
    imported key is later deleted.
    By default, keyset imports keys in ``decoupled`` state.
    When a decoupled key is later removed, only the reference is deleted from
    the key set.
    The file that contains the key is not deleted and the key is not deleted
    from an HSM.
    Passing the option ``--coupled`` when importing a key, directs keyset to
    take ownership of the key.

    The key pair can be imported in two ways:

    * file <PATH>

      The <PATH> argument refers to the public key. The filename of the
      private key is derived from the public key unless the ``--private-key``
      option is used to specify the filename that holds the private key.

      .. option:: --coupled

         Take ownership of the imported keys.

      .. option:: --private-key <PATH>

         Explicitly pass the name of the file that holds the private key.

    * kmip <SERVER> <PUBLIC_ID> <PRIVATE_ID> <ALGORITHM> <FLAGS>

      The <SERVER> argument specifies one of the KMIP servers that has been
      configured using the ``kmip add-server`` command.
      The <PUBLIC_ID> and <PRIVATE_ID> arguments are the KMIP identifiers of
      the public key and the private key respectively.
      The DNSSEC algorithm is specified using the <ALGORITHM> argument and
      finally the <FLAGS> argument (usually 256 or 257) is the value of 
      the flags field in the DNSKEY record for the public key.

      .. option:: --coupled

         Take ownership of the imported keys.

* remove-key <KEY>

  Remove a key or key pair from the key set.
  The <KEY> argument is the URL of the public key.
  If the key is ``coupled`` then the files that hold the keys are also removed
  or, in case of KMIP keys, the keys are removed from the HSM.
  Normally, keys are only removed when they are stale.

  .. option:: --force

     Force a key to be removed even if the key is not stale.

  .. option:: --continue

     Continue when removing a key file fails or when a key cannot be removed
     from an HSM.

* status

  Provide status information about key rolls, key expiration and signature
  expiration.

  .. option:: -v --verbose

     Make status verbose.

* actions

  Show the actions that have to be executed for any key rolls.

* keys

  Give detailed information about all keys in the key set.

* get

  Get the values of the following configuration variables: use-csk,
  autoremove, autoremove-delay, algorithm, ds-algorithm, dnskey-lifetime,
  cds-lifetime.
  This is a subset of all configuration variables.

  Additionally, the dnskey argument returns the current DNSKEY RRset plus
  signatures, cds returns the CDS and CDNSKEY RRsets plus signatures and
  ds returns DS records that should be added to the parent zone.

* set

  Set configuation variables.
  Note that setting configuration variables after the create command but
  before the init command can be used to affect the initial key creation.

  * use-csk <BOOLEAN>

    When true, new keys will be created as CSK otherwise a KSK and a ZSK
    will be created.

  * autoremove <BOOLEAN>

    When true, keys that are stale will be removed automatically.

  * autoremove-delay <DELAY>

    Set the delay between the time keys become stale and automatic
    removal.

  * algorithm <ALGORITHM>

    Set the algorithm to be used when creating new keys. Supported values
    are RSASHA256, RSASHA512, ECDSAP256SHA256, ECDSAP384SHA384, ED25519,
    and ED448.
    Not all values are supported for KMIP keys.

    .. option:: -b <BITS>

       For RSA keys, the length of the key in bits.

  * auto-ksk, auto-zsk, auto-csk, auto-algorithm

    These commands take four boolean arguments: <START> <REPORT> <EXPIRE> <DONE>.
    When set to true, the corresponding step or steps of the key roll specified
    by the command are executed automatically.

    For example, ``auto-csk true false true false`` means that
    CSK rolls will start automatically, that the propagation1-complete,
    propagation2-complete, and roll-done need to be executed manually.
    The cache-expired1 and cache-expired2 steps are executed automatically.

  * ds-algorithm <ALGORITHM>

    Set the hash algorithm to be used for generating DS records.
    Possible values are ``SHA-256`` and ``SHA-384``.

  * dnskey-lifetime <DURATION>, cds-lifetime <DURATION>

    When a DNSKEY RRset is signed (dnskey-lifetime) or when CDS or CDNSKEY
    RRsets are signed (cds-lifetime), how far in the future are the signatures
    set to expire.
    The duration is an integer followed by a suffix, ``s`` or ``secs`` for
    seconds, ``m`` or ``mins`` for minutes, ``h`` or ``hours``, ``d`` or ``days``, ``w`` or ``weeks``.

  * dnskey-remain-time <DURATION>, cds-remain-time <DURATION>

    The minimum amount of remaining time that signatures for the DNSKEY RRset
    (dnskey-remain-time) or the CDS or CDNSKEY RRsets (cds-remain-time) have
    to be valid.
    New signatures are generated when the remaining time drops below the
    specified duration.
    For the syntax of <DURATION> see ``dnskey-lifetime``.

  * dnskey-inception-offset <DURATION>, cds-inception-offset <DURATION>

    When generating signatures for the DNSKEY RRset (dnskey-inception-offset)
    or the CDS and CDNSKEY RRsets (cds-inception-offset), set the inception
    timestamp this amount in the past to compensate for clocks that are a
    bit off or in the wrong time zone.
    For the syntax of <DURATION> see ``dnskey-lifetime``.

  * ksk-validity <DURATION> | ``off``, zsk-validity <DURATION> | ``off``, csk-validity <DURATION> | ``off``

    Set how long a KSK, ZSK, or CSK is considered valid.
    The special value ``off`` means that no limit has been set.
    For the syntax of <DURATION> see ``dnskey-lifetime``.

    When a key is no longer considered valid and automatic starting of the
    appropriate key roll has been enabled then a key roll will start at the
    next invocation of the cron command.

    The status command shows which keys are no longer valid or when their
    validity will end.

  * update-ds-command

    Set a command to to run when the DS records in the parent zone need
    to be updated.
    This command can, for example, alert the operator or use an API provided
    by the parent zone to update the DS records automatically.

  * fake-time

    Set the 'wall clock' time to be used for testing.
    The argument is either the Unix time as seconds since Epoch or the string
    'off' to disable fake-time.

* show

  Show all configuration variables.

  Note that 'fake-time' is only printed when it is set.

* cron

  Execute any automatic steps such a refreshing signatures or automatic steps
  in key rolls.

* kmip

  The kmip command manages the list of configured KMIP servers and the
  default server to use for generating new keys.
  The kmip command has the following subcommands:

  * disable

    Disable use of KMIP for generating new keys.

  * add-server <SERVER-ID> <NAME-OR-IP>

    Add a KMIP server with name <SERVER-ID> and DNS name or IP address
    <NAME-OR-IP>.
    The name of the server is used in a key reference to identify which KMIP
    server holds the key.

    .. option:: --port <PORT>

       TCP port to connect to the KMIP server on. The default port is 5696.

    .. option:: --pending

       Add the server but don't make it the default.

    .. option:: --credential-store <CREDENTIALS_STORE_PATH>

       Optional path to a JSON file to read/write username/password
       credentials from/to.

    .. option:: --username <USERNAME>

       Optional username to authenticate to the KMIP server as.

    .. option:: --password <PASSWORD>

       Optional password to authenticate to the KMIP server with.

    .. option:: --client-cert <CLIENT_CERT_PATH>

       Optional path to a TLS certificate to authenticate to the KMIP server
       with.

    .. option:: --client-key <CLIENT_KEY_PATH>

       Optional path to a private key for client certificate authentication.

    .. option:: --insecure

       Accept the KMIP server TLS certificate without verifying it.

    .. option:: --server-cert <SERVER_CERT_PATH>

       Optional path to a TLS PEM certificate for the server.

    .. option:: --ca-cert <CA_CERT_PATH>

       Optional path to a TLS PEM certificate for a Certificate Authority.

    .. option:: --connect-timeout <CONNECT_TIMEOUT>

       TCP connect timeout. Default 3 seconds.

    .. option:: --read-timeout <READ_TIMEOUT>

       TCP response read timeout. Default 30 seconds.

    .. option:: --write-timeout <WRITE_TIMEOUT>

       TCP request write timeout. Default 3 seconds.

    .. option:: --max-response-bytes <MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES>

       Maximum KMIP response size to accept (in bytes). Default 8192 bytes.

    .. option:: --key-label-prefix <KEY_LABEL_PREFIX>

       Can be used to denote the s/w that created the key, and/or to indicate
       which installation/environment it belongs to, e.g. dev, test, prod,
       etc.

    .. option:: --key-label-max-bytes <KEY_LABEL_MAX_BYTES>

       Maximum label length (in bytes) permitted by the HSM. Default 32 bytes.

  * modify-server <SERVER-ID>

    Modify the settings of the server with ID <SERVER-ID>. This subcommand
    takes most of the options documented at ``kmip add-server``.
    Some options have the same name but are slightly different.
    There are also a few additional options.
    The new and modified options are listed below.

    .. option:: --address <IP_HOST_OR_FQDN>

       Modify the hostname or IP address of the KMIP server.

    .. option:: --no-credentials

       Disable use of username / password authentication.
       Note: This will remove any credentials from the credential-store for
       this server id.

    .. option:: --no-client-auth

       Disable use of TLS client certificate authentication.

    .. option:: --insecure <BOOLEAN>

       Modify whether or not to accept the KMIP server TLS certificate
       without verifying it.

  * remove-server <SERVER-ID>

    Remove an existing non-default KMIP server.
    To remove the default KMIP server use `kmip disable` first.
    A server cannot be removed if there are keys that reference it.

  * set-default-server <SERVER-ID>

    Set the default KMIP server to use for key generation.

  * get-server <SERVER-ID>

    Get the details of an existing KMIP server.

  * list-servers

    List all configured KMIP servers.
