Building From Source
====================

In order to build dnst from the source, you need to have Rust installed on
your system. The Rust compiler runs on, and compiles to, a great number of
platforms, though not all of them are equally supported. The official `Rust
Platform Support`_ page provides an overview of the various support levels.

While some system distributions include Rust as system packages, dnst
relies on a relatively new version of Rust, currently |rustversion| or newer.
We therefore suggest to use the canonical Rust installation via a tool called
:program:`rustup`.

Assuming you already have :program:`curl` installed, you can install
:program:`rustup` and Rust by simply entering:

.. code-block:: text

  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

Alternatively, visit the `Rust website
<https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>`_ for other installation methods.

Building and Updating
---------------------

..
    In Rust, a library or executable program such as dnst is called a
    *crate*. Crates are published on `crates.io
    <https://crates.io/crates/dnst>`_, the Rust package registry. Cargo is
    the Rust package manager. It is a tool that allows Rust packages to declare
    their various dependencies and ensure that you’ll always get a repeatable
    build. 

    Cargo fetches and builds dnst’s dependencies into an executable binary for
    your platform. By default you install from crates.io, but you can also
    install from a specific Git URL.

    Installing the latest dnst release from crates.io is as simple as
    running:

    .. code-block:: text

    cargo install --locked dnst

    The command will build dnst and install it in the same directory that
    Cargo itself lives in, likely ``$HOME/.cargo/bin``. This means dnst
    will be in your path, too.

    Updating
    """"""""

    If you want to update to the latest version of dnst, it’s recommended
    to update Rust itself as well, using:

    .. code-block:: text

        rustup update

    Use the ``--force`` option to overwrite an existing version with the latest
    dnst release:

    .. code-block:: text

        cargo install --locked --force dnst

    Installing Specific Versions
    """"""""""""""""""""""""""""

    If you want to install a specific version of
    dnst using Cargo, explicitly use the ``--version`` option. If needed,
    use the ``--force`` option to overwrite an existing version:
            
    .. code-block:: text

        cargo install --locked --force dnst --version 0.1.0-rc1

    All new features of dnst are built on a branch and merged via a `pull
    request <https://github.com/NLnetLabs/dnst/pulls>`_, allowing you to
    easily try them out using Cargo. If you want to try a specific branch from
    the repository you can use the ``--git`` and ``--branch`` options:

Crates are normally published on `crates.io <https://crates.io/>`_, the Rust

Cargo fetches and builds dnst’s dependencies into an executable binary for
your platform. By default you install from crates.io, but because dnst is not
yet published in the Rust package registry, you can currently only install it
directly from GitHub using the ``--git`` option. If you want to try a
specific branch, include the ``--branch`` option as well:

.. code-block:: text

    cargo install dnst --bin dnst --git https://github.com/NLnetLabs/dnst.git --branch main
    
.. Seealso:: For more installation options refer to the `Cargo book
             <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-install.html#install-options>`_.

Platform Specific Instructions
------------------------------

For some platforms, :program:`rustup` cannot provide binary releases to
install directly. The `Rust Platform Support`_ page lists
several platforms where official binary releases are not available, but Rust
is still guaranteed to build. For these platforms, automated tests are not
run so it’s not guaranteed to produce a working build, but they often work to
quite a good degree.

OpenBSD
"""""""

On OpenBSD, `patches
<https://github.com/openbsd/ports/tree/master/lang/rust/patches>`_ are
required to get Rust running correctly, but these are well maintained and
offer the latest version of Rust quite quickly.

Rust can be installed on OpenBSD by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   pkg_add rust
