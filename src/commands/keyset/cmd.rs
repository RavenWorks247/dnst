// Automatic key rolls
//
// Keyset supports four types of automatic key rolls:
// 1) A KSK roll. Roll one (or more) KSKs to a new KSK.
// 2) A ZSK roll. Roll one (or more) ZSKs to a new ZSK.
// 3) A CSK roll. Roll any KSK, ZSK, or CSK to a single new CSK or roll
//    one (or more CSKs) plus any KSK or ZSK to a new KSK plus a new ZSK.
//    This depends on the value of the use_csk config variable.
// 4) An algorithm roll. Roll any KSK, ZSK, or CSK to a new CSK (if use_csk
//    is true) or to a new KSK and a new ZSK (if use_csk is false) with an
//    algorithm that is different from the one in the old keys.
//
// For each roll type automation can be enable for four different types of
// steps:
// 1) Start. When automation is enabled for this step, keyset checks if keys
//    are expired, no conflicting rolls are currently in progress and no
//    conditions (use of CSK, the need for a algorithm roll) prevents this
//    type of roll.
// 2) Report. In the complete key roll, these are two steps:
//    propagation1_complete and propagation2_complete. When automation is
//    enabled, keyset goes through the list of actions and takes care of
//    the Report actions (ReportDnskeyPropagated, ReportDsPropagated,
//    ReportRrsigPropagated). Keyset checks nameservers for the zone
//    (or the parent zone in the case of ReportDsPropagated) to make sure
//    that new information has propagated to all listed nameservers.
//    The maximum TTL is passed to Keyset::propagation1_complete (or
//    Keyset::propagation2_complete).
// 3) Expire. This corresponds to the steps cache_expired1 and
//    cache_expired2. When enabled, this step wait until time equal to the
//    TTL amount that was reported in propagation1_complete or
//    propagation2_complete to have passed before continuing to the next step.
// 4) Done. When enabled this step takes care of any Wait actions
//    (WaitDnskeyPropagated, WaitDsPropagated, WaitRrsigPropagated). This
//    is very similar to the Report step except no TTL value is reported.
//    After this step, the key roll is considered done though some old date
//    may still exist in caches.
//
//  For each key roll type, automation for each step can be enabled or disabled
//  individually. This give a total of sixteen flags.
//
//  The function auto_start handles the Start step. The other steps are
//  handled by auto_report_expire_done. The current state for automatic report
//  and done handling is kept in a field called 'internal' in the KeySetState
//  structure.
//
//  At every change to the config or the state file, the next time
//  'dnst keyset cron' should be called is computed and stored in the
//  state file. The function cron_next_auto_start provides timestamps for
//  automatic start of key rolls, cron_next_auto_report_expire_done does
//  the same for the report, expire, and done steps.
