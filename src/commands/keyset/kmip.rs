//! KMIP support for the keyset subcommand.
//!
//! KMIP (OASIS Key Management Interoperability Protocol) is a specification
//! for communicating with HSMs (Hardware Security Modules) that implement
//! secure cryptographic key generation and signing of data using generated
//! keys.
//!
//! The functions and types in this module are used to extend `dnst keyset` to
//! support KMIP based cryptographic keys as well as the default Ring/OpenSSL
//! based keys.

// Note: Currently this is only used by `dnst keyset` but one can imagine it
// also being used by `dnst keygen`, `dnst key2ds` and `dnst signzone`. It may
// make sense to move the pure KMIP content from here to say src/kmip.rs and
// only keep the `dnst keyset` specific KMIP content in this module. One would
// also then need a way to configure which KMIP server the other subcommands
// should use and might want to also at that point consider a `dnst`-wide
// config mechanism for KMIP servers, e.g. `dnst kmip` or `dnst cfg kmip` or
// something.
